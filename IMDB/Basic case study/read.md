# **PivotCharts**

In the IMDb Movie Database-Homework workbook that you created at the end of the 
first section, complete the following:
1. Create a view to show # of Titles by Country, excluding the USA, for the 
entire sample. Name the PivotTable "Titles by Country", then use a 
PivotChart to visualize this view as a Clustered Column Chart.
2. Hide the Field Buttons from the PivotChart, then apply a value filter to only 
show the top 10 countries by # of Titles. Which country is #2?
3. Change the chart type to a Clustered Bar, and change the PivotTable 
sorting to ascending by # of Titles.
4. Pull in IMDb Score as a second series, and summarize values by Average. 
Change your PivotChart type to Combo, with # of Titles as a Clustered 
Column and IMDb Score as a Line with Markers, on the Secondary Axis. 
Which of the 10 countries generated the lowest average IMDb scores? 
(Bonus: Format the IMDb series in the chart to only show the markers, with 
no line)
5. Copy the existing pivot and create a second view below the combo chart to 
show Budget by Genre, with a Top 5 filter applied. Name the table "Budget 
by Genre", then visualize this view with a Pie chart, with hidden field 
buttons.
6. Insert a Slicer for Genre, enable multi-select, then connect it to both 
PivotTables. Create a simple dashboard by hiding the columns of your raw 
PivotTable views, disabling gridlines, and aligning/formatting the 
PivotCharts and Slicer as you see fit. Practice adjusting slicer selections to 
see how the dashboard updates
